# Project Statement

**py-Cipher-Tool** is a command line interface Python application that can performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar, Vigenère, and XOR ciphers. It showcases how to implement file input/output in an organized way and proper error handling.

## Problem Statement
Basic terminology in Encryption is essential for understanding concepts in Cyber Security. This tool caters to supplement the need for a straightforward, hands-on learning environment to work with classical cipher algorithms and hardware abstraction of data using the most basic primitives without requiring knowledge of complicated, modern cryptographic libraries.
